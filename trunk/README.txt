Welcome to the Parallel Cluster Sources!

Visit the doc directory in the trunk for some nice graphics documenting the high-level
design of the application. You can also find a Bouml class diagram there and some Dia
diagrams of Message Sequence Charts showing dynamic properties of the application. Some
text is included as well (along with the corresponding .tex file) explaining the layer
structure of the design.

The src subdirectory is very much a work in progress, patience. There you can find a
few C++ sources that should compile (only to generate an object file though) and a
Doxygen config file together with a README.txt explaining it all.

Although I'm the only author listed in the credits in each source file, I haven't coded
any of this. For now I'm documenting and jump-starting the project.

Greetings,

Billy
